Then an outcast village woodcutter, Alibaba, comes across Zakali's cave, which is located near Kali Pahadi, a valley that is still inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs, uses the magic words 'Khul Ja Sim Sim', and finds untold wealth in it. He decides to take some and distribute it amongst the poor villagers. Razia, his estranged brother, Qasim's wife, finds out and compels Alibaba to tell her husband the location of the cave.

Then an outcast village woodcutter, Alibaba, comes across Zakali's cave, which is located near Kali Pahadi, a valley that is still inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs, uses the magic words 'Khul Ja Sim Sim', and finds untold wealth in it. He decides to take some and distribute it amongst the poor villagers. Razia, his estranged brother, Qasim's wife, finds out and compels Alibaba to tell her husband the location of the cave. Qasim goes there, grabs as much as he can hold, but is unable to remember the magic words to exit the cave. Shortly thereafter Zakali returns, slices Qasim's body in half and leaves. Alibaba finds his brother's mutilated body, and he and his sweetheart, Marjina, secretly hire a cobbler, Mushtaq Mochee, to sew it together and make it ready for burial, which he does for a fat fee. When Zakali finds Qasim's body missing, he decides to attack Sonapur but is ambushed and many of his men are killed.

They have heard about a valley where peace always reigns, they fancy that it's the boy's uncle's house, and they set out to find it. At the same time an airplane is shot down and the Black American pilot jumped by parachute. He finds the children at a ford. There is absolutely no danger, but the girl is standing in the middle of the river, scared and crying, and neither she nor the boy dare to go forth or back. The pilot cannot abandon the children although they will reduce his chance of escaping. Both the Germans and the partisans know that the pilot had survived. Who will find him first? Several things happen in rapid succession. The children and the pilot find the uncle's house, which has long been empty. The Germans arrive and catch the pilot. The partisans attack and liberate the pilot, who joins them. But during the fight he is soon mortally wounded and orders the children to run away. Then the house explodes. The children conclude that this was the wrong valley and decide to continue to search for the right one, the peaceful one. —Max Scharnberg, Stockholm, Sweden"}, 8: {'title': 'V tiha vecher', 'poster_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VhMDRiYzYtM2NlYy00ZTBmLTgwM2QtYzM2NDg0MDMxMzY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1OTY0NjI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg', 'videos': '', 'genres': 'Drama War', 'storyline': 'Chased by the military police force, the partisans Boyka and Anton take refuge in a cave.

Then an outcast village woodcutter, Alibaba, comes across Zakali's cave, which is located near Kali Pahadi, a valley that is still inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs, uses the magic words 'Khul Ja Sim Sim', and finds untold wealth in it. He decides to take some and distribute it amongst the poor villagers. Razia, his estranged brother, Qasim's wife, finds out and compels Alibaba to tell her husband the location of the cave.

When Zakali finds Qasim's body missing, he decides to attack Sonapur but is ambushed and many of his men are killed.

Then an outcast village woodcutter, Alibaba, comes across Zakali's cave, which is located near Kali Pahadi, a valley that is still inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs, uses the magic words 'Khul Ja Sim Sim', and finds untold wealth in it.

They find temporary accommodations and set out to discover the mystery behind Kumar\'s dreams. Then a young woman, Sapna, meets with Kumar, tells him that she has been awaiting his return, and now they can be together again. But Kumar has never been to this place before, and ends up even more confused. Then another local villager named Bansi tells them he had himself seen Kumar getting killed and buried in the nearby forest. Kumar and Rocky must now find out who was killed, and why the villagers believe that Kumar has returned from the grave. —rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'}, 9: {'title': 'The Cavalier of the Streets', 'poster_url': '', 'videos': '', 'genres': nan, 'storyline': "A struggling writer is so deep in debt that he believes he'll never be able to get out of it, and is being hounded by creditors.

He suggests going by aeroplane, but Magda has a fear of heights. Robbie accidentally takes a routine emergency-training exercise seriously; that night a genuine emergency arises, but Robbie thinks it\'s just another drill. This foolish act leaves Magda no option but to leave the ship alone, making Robbie the only person aboard the ship when it sinks. Upon awakening, Robbie thinks everything is normal, but he soon discovers he is the one remaining person on board the entire ship, which is now at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
